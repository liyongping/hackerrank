/* 
 Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
  “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

         /  \
         7   4

For example, 
the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. 
Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
